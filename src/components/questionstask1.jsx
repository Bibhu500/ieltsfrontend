      image: fish,
      description:"The image illustrates a process flow diagram detailing the steps involved in the preparation and sale of smoked fish. It begins with a net full of fish, followed by a boat sailing to the port, indicating the initial catch and transportation. Next, the fish are placed in a container labeled 'Freeze,' suggesting a freezing step before they are cut open. After being cut, the fish are placed in fresh water to thaw. Following this step, the fish are smoked over a grill, then placed in salt water with yellow coloring. The subsequent step involves freezing the fish again at 0°C, after which they are moved to a cold store. The distribution phase shows a truck, indicating the fish are transported to their final destination. The process concludes at a fish shop where the smoked fish are sold to consumers. Each step is clearly marked and shows a logical progression from catch to sale." // Use the imported image directly

      text: "The bar chart provides information about how often people in the USA spent and ate at fast food restaurants from 2003 to 2013. Summarise the information and report the relevant details",
      image: restaurantgraph1,
      description:"The provided image is a bar graph titled 'Frequency of eating at fast food restaurants among people in the USA (2003–2013).' It shows six categories of frequency: 'Every day,' 'Several times a week,' 'Once a week,' 'Once or twice a month,' 'A few times a year,' and 'Never.' The graph compares these frequencies over three different years: 2003, 2006, and 2013, indicated by differently shaded bars for each year. In 2003, the highest frequency category is 'Once a week,' followed by 'A few times a year.' The 'Every day' category is the least common. By 2006, 'Once a week' still has the highest percentage, but there's a noticeable increase in the 'Every day' category. In 2013, 'Once a week' remains the most common frequency, but there's a slight decrease in 'Several times a week' and 'Once or twice a month' compared to 2006. The graph indicates a trend where the percentage of people eating fast food 'Every day' has increased from 2003 to 2013, while the percentage of those eating 'Several times a week' has slightly decreased. 'Never' consuming fast food appears to remain consistently the least common frequency across all three years." // Use the imported image directly

      description:"The image contains two graphs. The first graph, a bar chart, shows male and female Olympic participants in 1924, 1954, 1984, and 2014. In 1924, there were approximately 3,000 male and 250 female participants. In 1954, male participation increased to around 5,000, while female participation rose to about 1,000. The year 1984 shows a further increase, with males at slightly below 6,000 and females just over 2,000. By 2014, male and female participation levels were almost equal, with males just over 6,000 and females around 5,500. The second graph is a line graph titled 'Total Participants', illustrating a steady rise in the total number of participants from around 3,000 in 1924 to nearly 11,000 by 2014. This graph reflects the growing inclusivity and scale of the Olympic Games over the 90-year period."

        image: childrencharity,
        description:"The image presents two pie charts comparing the revenue sources and expenditures of a charity.

Community contributions account for 10.4%, while investment income and program revenue are much smaller at 2.2% and 0.2%, respectively. Other income and government grants contribute a minor 0.4% and 0.2%. The second chart details the charity's expenditures totaling $53,224,896, with a dominant 95.8% spent on program services. Fundraising costs account for 2.6%, and management and general expenses are slightly lower at 1.6%. Both charts emphasize the charity's focus on program services, funded predominantly through donations of food."  // Use the imported image directly

      image: linegraphcars,
      description:"The image is a line graph titled 'Comparison of car theft,' showing car theft rates per 100,000 vehicles in four different countries from 1990 to 1999. The lines represent Great Britain, Sweden, France, and Canada. Great Britain starts at just under 20 thefts per 100,000 vehicles in 1990, peaks at over 20 in the mid-90s, and ends slightly lower. Sweden's rate begins just under 10, peaks slightly above that in the mid-90s, and ends just below 10. France starts at approximately 7 thefts, with a slight upward trend until 1993, then a steady decline to just over 5. Canada shows a steady decrease from about 15 thefts in 1990 to just above 5 in 1999. The graph demonstrates that Great Britain had the highest car theft rates throughout this period, while Canada's rate decreased significantly to align closer with France by 1999. Sweden's theft rates remained relatively stable, and France showed an overall decline."  // Use the imported image directly
