          "Question": "Some people think that parents should teach their children how to be good members of society. Others, however, believe that school is the best place to learn this. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
          "Essay": "Some people believe that children should be taught by their parents about how to function as useful members of society, while others believe that sending children to educational institutions is the best way for them to study this. Although the latter opinion can be beneficial in some cases, I believe that family upbringing plays a more important role in educating children to be good parts of the community. Schools can be considered suitable places for children to learn to be good citizens. With standardized educational methods, schools can foster children’s cognitive development so that they are able to contribute to society in the future. For example, Trung Vuong school and Vinschool are well known for having nurtured successful alumni such as Professor Ngo Bao, Professor Nguyen Hung who have devoted their talents to the development of the country. However, these people only represent a small fraction of the total number of students attending schools, and thus sending children to schools cannot be the best method of educating them to be good members of society. I believe that parents play a more important role in teaching them how to be good citizens. In Vietnam, the average class size is 20 students, which makes it difficult for educators to provide proper schooling for each student. One to one lessons at home, on the other hand, allow children to progress faster. Furthermore, parents form stronger bonds with their offspring and thus, it is easier for them to shape children’s personalities at an early age. For example, by telling stories such as Robin Hood, Cinderella before bedtime, parents can instil a sense of compassion and integrity into them. These children are likely to become good members of society when they grow up. In conclusion, although sending children to schools can be seen as a way of teaching them how to be good citizens, I believe that domestic upbringing has a bigger impact on determining who they are in the future.",

          "Question": "There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?",
          "Essay": "Recently, the demands of natural resources have risen dramatically across the world due to
          population growth. Some people state that we have not enough resources. However, there are
          some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this
          phenomenon will be examined.
          On the one hand, some people state that if the number of natural resource will continue to
          degrease we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to
          a government research in the USA shows that if this situation will continue, the petrol will lose in
          2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the number of population in the world will increase. This will
          make the amount of natural resource decrease. On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception.
          The demands of natural resources will be lessen owning to improving the technology. For
          example, the developments of technology such as electronic cars gave a positive impact in the
          society. By using this, we can decline the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will
          not need natural fuel. In my opinion, decreasing of natural resource is quite crisis, I think the loss
          of it give a negative impact in the society because even we won’t have a comfortable life any
          more.
          In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain
          this situation. In order to defense our life, the governments every countries should tackle this

          "Question": "Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and
          the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school
          before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?",
          "Essay": "Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not
          enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and
          contribute less too, compared to those student who travel or work and get experience and skills
          before going high. There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group
          of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’. Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of
          course, theory is very neccessary, however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must
          have praticeable experience. This is what group A lack very much. Although in the third or fourth
          year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is
          still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t
          accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with
          other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute
          less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.
          Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many
          companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies
          take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other
          companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, Whereas group B
          members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills.
          Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B
          gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not
          only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to
          get a good job and have a brilliant future.",

          on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?",
          "Essay": "Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs,
          Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look
          forward to the future of computers. In what field will be computers used for and what role will
          human has in this world in future? Besides, computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we
          plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and Internet.
          Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the
          Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of
          HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already selling
          housewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.
          Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more
          time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent
          with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a
          specific computer can entail serious consequences. Suffice to mention the computer problem
          that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and
          catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is
          difficult to imagine what could be if all the predictions came true.
          We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide
          and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank

          "Question": "In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as
          completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for
          learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?",
          "Essay": "Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial
          assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is
          a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several
          reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I
          would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly
          paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing
          dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually do not
          provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future carrer This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour argues that it is an effective
          method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a
          real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may
          neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may
          become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave
          school.
          Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand
          how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a
          certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at
          an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.
          In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work,
          otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.",

          "Question": "Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or
          individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree
          or disagree?",
          "Essay": "An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so
          contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for
          the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is
          vital that environmental issues are treated internationally. Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste
          treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. For sure joint efforts and consolidation
          can only help in the mutual war towards the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance,
          governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing,
          industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not
          confess that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take adequately care of it. We have
          to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always
          remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use.
          Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving
          vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the
          engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save
          energy and simply open the windows.
          To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as
          well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to
          bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.",

          "Essay": "Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must
          acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor.
          Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century,
          tolerance and respect for life are important values. Moreover, we can affirm that all the Europe
          remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a
          typical value in the Old Catholic world. Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is
          not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of
          punishment has its higher rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes
          against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this
          penalty will continue into a future next. Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course
          cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical.
          The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us
          to other questions concerning revenge and justice. It will be better to kill a person because of his
          crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation
          is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost
          forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this
          sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.",

          with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of
          poorer nations to look after their citizens?",
          "Essay": "I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. But their
          helping should only stop at providing such things as food and education because of the three
          following reasons. Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can
          not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, etc... without compassion and
          sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a task .
          Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are very very poor. Famine, diseases, crime and
          illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. In the contrary, many nations in Europe and, America are too rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor
          countries will become more and more poorer while rich countries will become more and more
          richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing
          wealth is an useful way to prevent people from that bad future.
          Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessary but this help should only
          stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may
          become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves.
          Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of
          poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.
          In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we
          have to do is avoiding its bad side and practicing its good side.",

          "Question": "Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them
          with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of
          poorer nations to look after their citizens?",
          "Essay": "I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. But their
          helping should only stop at providing such things as food and education because of the three
          following reasons. Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can
          not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, etc... without compassion and
          sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a task .
          Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are very very poor. Famine, diseases, crime and
          illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. In the contrary, many nations in Europe and, America are too rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor
          countries will become more and more poorer while rich countries will become more and more
          richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing
          wealth is an useful way to prevent people from that bad future.
          Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessary but this help should only
          stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may
          become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves.
          Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of
          poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.
          In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we
          have to do is avoiding its bad side and practicing its good side.",

          "Question": "Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what
          extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?",
          "Essay": "Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the offender are unable to get involved in the
          crime in the future. However, If they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would
          be better to forget him and judge him for a change. Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the crime to be increased and
          hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good man and there is a
          particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice
          option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he have. Although by this way, some bad man
          may become effective part of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path
          because they are very much used to of it. The person that _ involved in the crime and never try to
          stop the law-breaking act should be punished in the extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some crime led to a capital punishment and some may require a
          small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level
          of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may
          become our society less secure for the good man. The government should be the responsible
          authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed
          in the most proper way that do not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law
          in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state runner to stop people
          to involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to
          commit that violence act or by the punishment accordingly.",

          People take very easy and quickly. Also modern medicine is very quick absorbing to human body.
          It is helps to back to normal for people health condition. Therefore I agree that the modern
          medicine is helps to live longer. First of all, the modern medicine can prevent incurable diseases. Doctors can find some diseases
          very early. Then doctors can give suitable medicines to patients. New modern equipments are
          helps doctors is going to correct way. Also intelligent people in the world live a long life on helps
          from modern medicine. That is very important in the human society because their creative things
          are coming with them and they can help others for a longer time when they are living in long life
          with comfortably Beside, old population is increasing in the country. It is badly effect in country’s economy and
          especially for third world countries. But old people are very important in human society because
          their experience definitely helps to living safely and planning to new project. ‘Experience is better
          than qualifications’ However, old people are living a long life; it is helping others to live a long life
          because we can get advice from them and they are covering our culture and society.
          Moreover, modern medicine is being addictive for some people, so that they cannot live without
          medicine. They should take medicine all their lives. Also modern medicine is very expensive.
          Therefore most of poor countries couldn?t take modern medicine and it has taken a commercial
          shape, also it is depending on money. In the modern medicine have not facts of human kindness.
          People who have money can take modern medicine. But indigenous medicine has well human
          friendly shape. It does not depend on money.
          To summarize; in my personal view, modern medicine is helping to live a long life with
          comfortably. Modern technologies are being supported to find unburnable diseases very early. So
          doctors can take correct path immediately. Therefore, may I not hesitate to agree with the above

          "Essay": "It is true that nowadays parent have a great influence over the children. Some people hold the
          opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others have a
          negative attitude. As far as I am concerned, I agree that boys are most influenced by their fathers
          and girls are most influenced by their mothers. My arguments for this point are listed below.
          First of all, a father is the person who have already passed that ways which are his son is passing
          now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. So, based on experience it is easy
          for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.
          Secondly, it is true that a boy is countedas a strong characteristics human , but a girl is a subtle
          and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that
          vulnerable something can affect a strong one.
          In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at
          least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same
          gender",

          enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do
          you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?",
          
          "Essay": "Pets have become far more familiar within mankind community, and indeed, the importance of
          relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in
          some nations. However, although problems regarding animals’ hairs may affect the health
          conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and
          mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.
          In term of physical benefits, the well-being conditions of elderly people with pets are more
          favourable compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of
          themselves, __ the responsibility that ensure their love one being fed and well looked after
          encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this though might
          not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad living
          styles. Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is
          that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling loneliness. Therefore,
          their depressing rate could be minimised. In spite of the above advantages, the threats of too close interaction between pets and vulnerable
          old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the harmfulness of these animal hairs on their
          tracheas, especially those with asthma. Because of the virtually invisible in the air, many asthma
          symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might
          experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, which could
          become even more challenge when they try t take care of others.
          In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the
          benefits of this topic outnumber its shortages. For such reasons, instead of discontinuing them,
          further support would be far more beneficial.",

          for what they do on their leisure time, and nobody can say what it is the best Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer to relax by watching
          movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have a physically jobs such as doctors,
          teachers and builders may choose these types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that
          you want to let your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run after work,
          because you are already physically tired. On the other hand, some people choose to be active in their leisure time because they do very
          sitting jobs. For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and do their work. At
          the end of a working day, they may be have a backache, and all of their body become tired so they
          need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the
          gym or swimming.
          To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for

          developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to
          allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your
          opinion?",
          
          "Essay": "The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in their society.
          Besides that, it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not
          females. Therefore, there exist a statement that companies should allocate to women a certain
          number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.
          In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society favour the males, and at that time
          instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it stills to happen in
          some developing countries; also it is greatly involved to women's right. A large number of women
          in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to public place. In this case, this is not
          an individual issue, but it is a social problem. The governments should have some solution to
          react with this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to
          protect women’s right. On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations,
          they do not distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any
          employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, that person will be
          promoted to high positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women
          is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions cannot count by
          fingers. Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.
          In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social
          issue worth to concern. Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for
          women to have an equal life as we can.

          "Essay": "Nowadays, the population increase dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true
          for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation cause a different number of problems.
          However, the government can solved these problems in many solution.
          There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes.
          Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits
          the number of children per family to educate in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually
          have a lot of unemployment as well, and when the population increases, the number of
          unemployment increase. Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers. There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult
          for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is
          generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, and
          ect. Which that often cause by the high rates of unemployment.
          However, overpopulation problems in both nations have two main solution which they aredeal by
          governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family.
          For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the
          family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded
          nation.
          To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in
          the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult

          "Essay": "Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the
          education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be
          right.
          Education is the foundation of well developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder for
          success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized
          and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well.
          Besides this, education also creates a good employment opportunity and therefore country does
          not have to suffer from big problems like unemployment. Educated peoples are more aware of
          problems such as pollution and many more. A country becomes technologically advanced
          because of educated people. Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like
          iliteracy, poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The
          crime rate can also be kept under check. The standard of living of the people will go up. If the
          nations wants to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and
          progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of
          education.
          However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country.
          Such as governments have to encouraged people to do so._
          In conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.

          they choose by them self. I believe that the most common reason why people attend to university
          or collage to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their
          knowledge of their personality.
          Firstly, many people attend to university or collage to have new experience in life. Many students
          leave their home and move to live by them self when they go to university. This is the first time
          that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help. Making their own
          decisions will increase their knowledge of themselves. Moreover, students on the university can
          meet different students from different nationalities and religions so students can learn about
          different culture around the world. Secondly, many people go to university or collage to prepare for a career. Career training is
          becoming more important nowadays to young people compared to old people. At college,
          students learn many skills for their career and they intern to internship with a lot of chances. All
          of these things prepare them for their career.
          Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality on
          life. They attend for that to increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For
          example, many students study science because they are iinterest in science but they work on the
          business area.
          To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college.
          They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great
          world around them which they live in.",

          opinion?.
          ",
          
          "Essay": "Almost 90% of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet
          programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have tought and gone on a
          diet before either to slim dowm or just for health problem.
          A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a healtier eating
          habits. For instance taking more vegetables and fruits that meat, avoid fried food and carbonated
          drinks. For a diet programme we shouldn’t cut one self from food and water. There are some diet
          programmes from the doctors that help you to have a healty heart like the “Three day diet” which
          we can find on the Internet. This programme allows you to eat fruits and also some meat. This
          way of dieting will help you to avoid some of the health problems in the future like diebetes or a
          heart attack. However some people do not only go on a diet but they avoid eating and go hungry for the whole
          day. All they have is just either water or juices. Also there a people who buy special diet
          programmes over the counter like taking pills which are not approved by the health department
          and they are doing so without consulting a doctor first. They do not follow the basic rules of
          dieting and this will lead them to some serious health problems like disfuctional of some body
          parts or, even worse, death.
          In my opinion there is notting wrong with going on a diet as long as we follow the correct way of
          eating and for a good reason to diet.

          countries and people. It involes in locomotion, communication, knowledge and skills.
          Globalazation is gaining speen over the entire world. It has attract enough world attention needed
          from international organization in promoting and encouraging human right and freedom ,
          opportunities, economic, social and culture rights.
          However, there are some countries that are missing out the opportunities that are offered and its
          taken as a big problem to their country. They are the poorer countries that are not connected to
          the people globally and their people are unskilled due to the lack of knowledge and equipments.
          They are also unable to trade with the other countries which are richer and larger as they are
          unable to meet the demand propose of them. They also will not have the opportunities and the
          challenges that are require. Globalization has also encourage crimes like the illegal drug trafficking around the world through
          the air, sea and land. This has involved human smuggling and stuffing it in anything they come
          across. This has affected a lot of problems to the country and the families of the drug addicts.
          This will also lead to other crimes like robbery and violence in the country.
          Another negative side of globalization is the dumping of the dangerous waste to the river, sea or
          the ocean. This will effect the aquactic creature, contaninate the water and cause harm to the
          people too.
          To conclude, globalization has contributed a lot to the world’s econnmics but the international
          organization should also not forget the poorer countries and the countries should also tackle its
          other negative sides that affect the world.",

          things thanin the past. They are bound to have a craving on all this stuff that they see. In other
          words children will be spending money on anything they want or find it interesting to them. Even
          some adults these days have some kind of craving to the thing they find it amazing. If financial education starts at the very beginning of the school years, this will help them to
          understand the value of money. Children should also be taught to manage their expenses and
          ways to spend wisely. When a child is being taught this in the school program, the child will be
          able to apply it when they are out to purchase or when they have left the school. They will not be
          cheated when they are young and this will not only benefit their families but also the whole
          country where they live when they are older. However, there are some children that are capable of handle the their financial in a very positive
          way even before they learned it at school. This children would have learnt from their families or
          people around them. They manage money better, compared to the other children from wealthier
          families for whom spending is not a problem.
          My conclusion is, children regardless of their background should be taught financial education
          from school at the very beginning then only parents guide them from home as well.

          "Essay": "Dieting seems to be part of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health
          conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they
          believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people
          who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.
          In our urban society, most of the working class person does not have the opportunity to consume
          a healthy meal. Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and
          salt. The most significant prove of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among
          those middle age working professionals. Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in
          shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of
          maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and
          avoid alcohol.
          However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all
          for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting
          medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy dieting will
          cause internal damage in the long run.
          In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive.
          Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional advise if they are unable to
          reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and
          losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.

          "Question": "Nowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians. What are the reasons for this? Is it a
          positive or negative development?",
          
          "Essay": "Nowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will
          look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative
          development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them
          is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money,
          such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some
          advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this
          is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can
          easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided
          to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.
          I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main
          one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap
          between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or
          even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low
          salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming
          politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens’ loyalty
          to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social
          problem. In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a
          wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a
          politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend
          which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments.

          "Question": "Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent
          and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?",
          
          "Essay": "Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the
          opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible
          application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and
          easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce
          both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them. Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime
          prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced
          technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can,
          indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the
          offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of
          them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old
          ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make
          a big difference to the crime levels.
          Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology.
          Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update
          courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two
          examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster.
          Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems
          with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined
          effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down. To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that
          they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting
          themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction
          in crime rate and make the world a safer place.

          "Question": "Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed
          to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
          ",
          
          "Essay": "The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a
          great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or
          not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art,
          and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and
          put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with
          foreign artworks to a certain extent. If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums,
          that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would
          gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism
          and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also
          receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a
          significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art.
          However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of
          creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.
          People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions,
          and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is
          irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how
          much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to
          be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our
          museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against
          the democratic nature of art. To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art
          created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists
          while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.

          ",
          
          "Essay": "There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people’s lives, especially in
          the field of education. Nowadays, an increasing number of students rely on computers for
          research and to produce a perfect paper for school purposes. Others have decided to leave the
          original way of learning and to get knowledge through online schools. These changes in the
          learning process have brought a special concern regarding the possible decrease of importance
          of teachers in the classroom. Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been helping
          some students to progress in their studies quicker compared to studies in an original classroom.
          For example, in the same classroom, students have different intellectual capacities, thus some
          would be tied to a slow advance in their studies because of others’ incapability of understanding. In this way, pupils could progress in their acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using
          computers instead of learning from teachers.
          However, the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact
          influences them in positive ways. Firstly, students realize that they are not dealing with a machine
          but with a human being who deserves attention and respect. They also learn the importance of
          studying in a group and respect for other students, which helps them improve their social skills.
          Moreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some
          students’ deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same explanation,
          giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor. Hence, students can have a better
          chance of avoiding a failure in a subject.
          In conclusion, the role for teachers in the learning process is still very important and it will
          continue to be such in the future because no machine can replace the human interaction and its
          consequences.

          "Essay": "More and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some
          that it should be mandatory to educate school children in the administration of money. In my
          opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.
          To begin with, a country’s development is strongly dependend upon the purchasing capacity of its
          inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to
          spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the
          country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford
          even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of
          this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy
          household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores
          due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early in money
          management. Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage
          their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being
          socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities,
          such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their withdraw from social life. However,
          this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.
          In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their
          finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of
          their country.

          "Question": "Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say
          that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while
          others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your
          own opinion.
          ",
          
          "Essay": "Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part
          of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the
          ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the
          governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will
          be offered. It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it
          seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast
          majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation
          of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover,
          consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will
          contaminate the environment.
          However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental
          changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal
          vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to
          resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important
          ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and
          websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect
          the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where
          legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame
          most environmental problems. In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse
          environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention
          from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.

          solutions can be offered?
          ",
          
          "Essay": "Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue.
          Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in school going children. There are
          various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.
          The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers,
          pizzas, noodles and coke. These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens.
          Children love to purchase chips, chocholates, - ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era,
          parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their
          children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This
          problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning
          junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch The second cause of obesity is sedentry life style. It is true that the use of computers and
          television is increasing in children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing
          video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical
          activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do
          physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends.
          Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their
          students.
          To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical
          activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating habbits and physical
          exercises.

          "Question": "Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you
          think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?
          ",
          
          "Essay": "At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in
          wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the
          probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions
          that will result in reducing food waste.
          The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to
          the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the
          quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the
          crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices
          have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of
          food without a real need. Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be
          considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems.
          Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies
          unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their
          national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.
          Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and
          governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social
          media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how
          communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people
          and companies will deter such harmful practice. In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate
          trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are
          parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.

          "Essay": "In modern day society, education has become a vital aspect of every child’s life. Educational
          facilities tend to offer a wide range of subjects aimed at educating children and teaching them
          various skills. Fundamental subject areas are said to be mathematics, science, languages and
          physical education. Whilst some have the ideology that musical education is an important part of
          growing up, others believe that it should no longer be taught in schools, as it is considered a
          waste of time and resources. In my view, it is important to incorporate music in children’s
          education as it promotes creativity.
          Typically people judge that learning to express oneself in a creative manner is less important
          than learning about mathematical theories and scientific facts. Music falls under the subject area
          of art, causing it to often be considered as less valuable than other subjects. Often the opponents
          of musical education propose that a more rationally-based education will benefit children later on
          in their lives, as they will be able to perceive and comprehend the logical aspects of life more
          easily. The supporters of musical education, on the other hand, argue that music is beneficial for
          children, because it offers a manner of creative self-expression. It is important for a child to learn
          about thinking creatively and to take a break from logical subjects once in a while. Furthermore, music is a salient part of human culture, as it brings people together and therefore children who
          study music can obtain a sense of cultural knowledge.
          In conclusion, music should be taught at school, because it enables children to express
          themselves creatively and to learn more about culture and human interaction. I, personally,
          benefited from musical education, because I played piano for seven years and believe that this
          has helped me become a more balanced person.

          "Question": "Although the prices of fuels have greatly increased over the last decade or two, it is argued that
          further increases in fuel prices are the only way to reduce world consumption of fuel and lessen
          pressure on the world’s fuel resources. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?
          ",
          
          "Essay": "Oil, gas and coal are all non-renewable resources. This is known worldwide, as well as the fact
          that society lives above its demands. Even though fuel prices have increased significantly over
          the last decade, consumption will still cause these resources to run out eventually. It has been
          argued that the only way to decrease the usage of fuel is to further increase the prices.
          Currently, most people think in the present and do not consider the future enough. Therefore, to
          affect people in their everyday lives, fuel prices ought to be raised. It is theorised that this will
          significantly decrease fossil fuel usage, as economic impact will be forced onto current users. It
          is necessary that fuel prices are high enough to immediately decrease the wealth of a family and
          make more people switch to public transport. Critics of this would argue, however, that society’s
          fossil fuels, such as petrol for cars, have an inelastic price and that price hikes would have no
          effect other than increasing tax and oil company revenues. In addition, a significant increase in prices would not only impact each individual, but also a
          whole economy. Fuel prices are not only linked to transport, but also to food production, home
          heating and entertainment. A rise in prices in all these areas would seriously affect the standard
          of living of families with limited income and would mean the poorer parts of society would
          become even poorer. In conclusion, while raising fuel prices is one of the most commonly-discussed solutions to fuel
          usage problems, this answer includes too many negative variables. Certainly, increasing fuel
          prices would create a small reduction of transport usage, but the far-reaching effects would be
          unfair and unsustainable.

          "Essay": "In many modern day families, it is a common aspect of family life that parents give jobs to their
          children to do around the house to develop their characters and a sense of self-sufficiency. This
          aspect can be looked at as having both positive and negative sides.
          When parents give their children jobs or chores to do around the house, they make their children
          understand that they are part of a community. While this community is only within the family’s
          house, the lessons children learn from carrying out their chores are equally fitting for the global
          community they live in. Children are taught that they have to integrate into the global community
          and that in order for this community to work effectively, everyone must carry out their chores. Furthermore, children learn about the concept of pride, as they are taught to be proud of what
          they have accomplished. Chores around the house additionally prepare children for living
          independently later on in life, as they acquire skills that are valuable for everyday life. I, personally,
          see this approach as very practical; helping my mother with cooking in my childhood and teenage
          years served me well, and living independently now I don’t have trouble preparing meals for
          myself and my housemates.
          Although there are many supporters of this concept, some parents argue that children should not
          be given jobs to do around the house. They argue that children should be allowed to be children
          and not have any duties. In their opinion children should enjoy their childhood and should not
          have to deal with any of the responsibilities adults have to deal with.
          In conclusion, I believe that giving children chores to carry out is a positive aspect of family life,
          as I think that it helps children to become independent and makes it easier for them to live by

          necessary and beneficial as it creates the growth of the world’s economy and society.
          Discuss both these views and give your opinion. -Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or

          "Essay": "The population of the world is ever growing. Some people believe that this increase has created
          an unsustainable situation and that it will lead to a global crisis. Other people believe that only
          through an increasing population can the world’s economy and society develop.
          This population increase is not constant around the world; population is undergoing significant
          growth especially in less developed countries, and the continent of Africa is predicted to undergo
          the highest increase. Many people living in these less developed countries frequently face
          shortages, such as water, food, heating, cooking fuel and medicines, and people have to live in
          substandard living conditions by western standards. With more inhabitants, these difficulties will
          become exacerbated and helping these countries might also create strain on the resources and
          economies of other countries. On the other hand, many countries are unable to reach their economic potential due to a lack of
          skilled work forces. For these countries a growing population can mean a stronger economy and,
          due to that, a better standard of living. Growing populations can also lead to growing demand for
          goods, allowing economies to expand. The problem is, however, that countries that are in need of
          labour forces and increasing demand are already the more developed countries and they meet
          some of these needs by immigration and exporting goods.
          In conclusion, it is my belief that while certain areas of the world are in need of larger work forces
          to develop their economies, the continuously increasing population could potentially lead to crisis
          within countries that already struggle to provide for their inhabitants.

          "Question": "It seems clear that obesity in today’s society is to some extent due to the availability of fast
          food. Should governments place a tax on fast food to reduce the amount of fast food consumed? ",
          
          "Essay": "Obesity has become a common problem in western societies and this is partly due to the
          availability of fast food at low prices. To tackle this problem, it has been suggested that
          governments should increase the tax on fast foods in order to reduce the amount of pre-cooked
          meals consumed. I personally believe that this is a sound idea, because especially young people,
          who have less money, will be discouraged from buying food at quick service restaurants.
          The main reason for the high consumption of junk food is that it is a cheap alternative to healthy
          meals. A salad for example often is twice as expensive as a burger, resulting in more people
          eating the burger than the salad. As a result, people prepare fewer meals themselves and eat
          more mass-produced food instead. In my opinion, it should not be possible to sell fast food at a
          lower price than staple food. By making takeaway meals more expensive than vegetables and
          fruit, people would change their eating habits, as they would want to save money. Another way to reduce consumption of fast food would be to prohibit its promotion. A similar
          approach was taken in terms of advertising cigarettes and one can say that this approach has
          been successful to some extent. Additionally, commercials for fast food often target young
          children through offering inducements, such as the toys in the happy meal at McDonalds for
          example. The children are persuaded to demand a happy meal, yet often do not necessarily want to eat the food contained in it. The only thing they want is the toy. If advertising junk food were
          forbidden, the number of children consuming pre-cooked meals would be reduced and therefore
          the number of obese children would decrease as well.
          In conclusion, governments should put a tax on fast food to reduce the amount consumed in
          order to decrease the number of obese people. By placing a tax on fast food and making it more
          expensive than healthy raw foods, people would began to eat more healthily. If additionally the
          advertising of quick service restaurants were banned, the number of obese people would
          decrease even more drastically.",

          "Question": "Today’s society provides people with various ways to lose weight, such as special diets or
          exercise regimes. Many people believe though that poor food and today’s lifestyle should be
          addressed first. What is your opinion?",
          
          "Essay": "In modern day western society one can easily become obese, as the availability of cheap and
          unhealthy food is high. Nonetheless, many people desire to be healthy and slim and therefore
          have chosen to follow special diets or exercise regimes so as to not become obese. Others
          believe, however, that people should be better informed about today’s unhealthy lifestyles and the
          poor food they are consuming before such diets and regimes are taken into consideration.
          Personally, I agree that the unhealthy lifestyle of many people must be addressed before thinking
          about ways of losing weight through special diets.
          It has become habitual for people to cook using ingredients that have been pre-cooked or to
          which chemicals have been added. Additionally, several people consume a lot of microwave and
          fast food, which are both easy to purchase and prepare, but are often fairly unhealthy. Due to the
          fact that it has become less popular to cook meals using fresh ingredients, people consume
          chemicals, taste intensifiers, salt and sugar without realising. By consuming food that has been
          made by mass production, one no longer has to think largely about how a meal is prepared and
          can simply consume it without thinking about the ingredients. It seems logical that in order to lose weight effectively and over a long period of time, one has to
          learn to eat in a healthy way and to carry out sport on a regular basis. Learning how to cook with
          fresh ingredients is an important aspect of eating in a healthy way, and, by doing so, people can
          avoid eating food that has been pre-made. If people do not understand this concept, they will fall
          back into unhealthily habits after their diet is over.
          In conclusion, today’s unhealthy lifestyles as well as the poor quality food consumed by people
          on a regular basis must be addressed before thinking about diets or exercise regimes. If people
          can combine exercise with wholesome eating habits, they will be happier and healthier.

          How can this be achieved? Discuss and give your opinion",
          
          "Essay": "In a world with an ever-growing population, providing housing is one of the crucial tasks of all
          governments. At the same time, however, the environment has to be protected from too much
          destruction and deforestation. Different solutions have been created to solve these problems.
          One significant solution could be increasing the height of buildings.
          When looking at the skyline of metropolitan cities, skyscrapers are becoming increasingly visible.
          The reason for this is simple: housing has to be provided, while the environment should suffer the
          least amount possible. Decreasing the building footprints of houses and therefore the
          destruction of environment, while increasing the height, is an effective solution in overcoming
          this dilemma. This resolution also has its faults though, as increasing height also means that
          sunlight reaching the streets will decrease and that housing will be built more densely in order to
          save space. Another possible solution is to increase building costs to pressure the population into living in
          smaller areas, which would save space. As this impacts members of the community unevenly
          depending on their wealth, this would encourage unequal living standards and conflicts as a
          result of this. Therefore, this is not a plausible solution to the problem. In my opinion, finding the perfect way to minimise environmental damage while increasing
          housing is a problem to which there is no simple solution. Many governments are currently
          relying on height to solve the problem, but this is not attractive to many people. Any solution
          chosen should be one that causes the fewest problems.

          over the last two centuries. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.",
          
          "Essay": "Over the last two hundred years, there have been many changes to society in nearly all aspects of
          people’s lives. Medical science has advanced beyond recognition and it can be argued that this
          has been the most significant change.
          The last two centuries have witnessed great advances of the industrial revolution. Automation,
          machinery and various technologies have revolutionised the way people live, work, play and
          travel. Society has now many things that make people’s lives easier and more enjoyable, including
          cars, planes, computers and telephones to name only a few. It is quite clear that these advances
          are phenomenally significant in most people’s lives today. Medical science has also been revolutionised. The three principal challenges facing surgery,
          which were pain, infection and bleeding, have all been overcome, allowing the lives of millions to
          be saved. The discoveries of vaccines to deal with the great killer diseases of history also took
          place over the last two centuries. Probably billions of people who would have died from diseases
          such as smallpox, tuberculosis, diphtheria and tetanus have all been saved.
          In addition to this, medicine now has such an advanced knowledge of human body systems that
          doctors can cure or heal a wide range of ailments that would in the past have been fatal or
          extremely debilitating. It is also likely that the next century will see similar significant advances.
          In conclusion, although there have been many different advances in society over the last two
          hundred years, the fact that so many people have had their lives saved or improved by medical
          breakthroughs makes it seem incontrovertible that it is these medical advances that have been
          the most significant.",

           and job training should be used instead. Do you agree or disagree?",
          
          "Essay": "It is often considered that a few individuals reckon that effective way to punish the
           criminals are sending them to jails. Whereas, some populations believe that offering them to
           learn and doing job tranings are benefial rather than in prison. Thus, I dissent from the
           notion which further leads to a logical conlcusion. Commencing, the crimes rates are increasing day
           by day like robbery, kidnapping, etc., and due to this, manyfold folks are suffering from huge
           loss in in respect of money or a family member. Moreover, the cause of doing crime is because of
           lack of money and food for their family although if criminals do not have sufficient knoweledge
           or education then unwillingly, they have to do for the fulfilment of their family demands or deisres.
           For instance, "The Times of India" an Indian newspaper illustrates a person who had done a robbery for
            the treatment of his who is wife suffering from critical disease and the cure is expensive.          
           Probing ahead, the populations who are indulging in these activities because they are compelled to do,
           as they do not have any other medium. However, the government should not punish them but they should
           make them capable to perform job by providing education and trainings so this will not let them to do any
           crime. For example, the federal officials of the United Kingdom passes a scheme in which the prisoners 
           are offered to study and give them opportunity to ameliorate their future.          
           In a nutshell, the contemporary world is full of educational institutes but it is very costly, therefore, the state authorities should support by cash to underpriviledged people and also encourage them to study.",

Some population believe that the government should play a vital role for solving this issue. Thus, I dissent from the notion which further leads to a logical conlcusion.

          Commencing, the contemporary era consists of a number of youngsters with unique concept on food and their body weight although some of them are not concious about their body figure while others are serious about that. However, intake of healthy or unhealthy diet, depend on the juveniles and additionally, they should do exercises regularly to gain fit and structured body size.
          
          For instance, the scientist in Australia researched the cause of overweight children and as a consequence, the student themselves are responsible for their body size and weight.
          
          Probing ahead, the federal authorities are not completely give solution to the society but they can make aware the masses that in what conditions or environments the meals are prepared. Moreover, the government officials also compelled the companies to mention the composition of ingredients along with fats so that folks will understand and eat accordingly. For example, in India, there are many unofficial street foods or food points in which crowds are always in queue and they always fond of eating these kinds of junkies even knowing that it is not healthy.
          
          In a nutshell, the representatives have the resposibility to make aware the population rather than giving spoon feeding as it's a duty of a single person to decide what to eat or not. Instead of eating processed food, prefer home made cuisines.",

Although few folks opine that  zoos can be useful in protecting the life of forest animals.However in my opinion  zooes are themost merciless and should be shutdown  as soon as possible.

          on the one hand animals in the wild are facing many problems by human beings such as destruction of habitat,poaching and cutting down trees.following on from this some people argue that animals saving by bred in captivity inside the zooes. The reason is these caged animals were looking after or take care by trained staff  and verterinary  surgeons. for instance, to  support this statement there is an eample such as with panda.In past years panda were extinct any how it is safe from the danger by being kept and bred in the zooes 
          
           on the other hand, there are some arguments convey that numerous jungle animals caged for the purpose of entertainment and massive income this lead animal to loss  frredom of them. for example in wild elephants can obtain huge amount of meal and water that provide by zooes.
          
          In many  situation visitors of zooes are disturbing animals by making them angry with their improper behaviour. for instance when i was visited the dehiwala zoo, i was able to watch that small children throwing stons inside the caged monkeys.
          
          In conclusion, protection  of animals is one of the major and prominent part of the human but this is not be in the  sanctutary because this is not be simar to  their habitat and they should be shut down.",

              "feedback": "The essay presents views on both sides of the argument regarding the usefulness and cruelty of zoos. However, to enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of your argument, it's crucial to ensure that your introduction clearly outlines your stance. Furthermore, your conclusion should succinctly summarize the discussed points and reiterate your position. This will significantly improve the coherence of your essay. Your essay lacks a clear structure that logically progresses from one point to the next. To improve coherence, consider organizing your essay into well-defined paragraphs, each dedicated to a single main idea. Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence, followed by supporting sentences that develop the idea further. This approach will enhance the logical flow and make your argument more compelling. Your essay would benefit from a more varied and precise vocabulary, as well as attention to grammatical accuracy. Frequent spelling mistakes (e.g., 'sanctutary', 'zooes', 'frredom') and grammatical errors distract from your argument and can confuse the reader. Consider proofreading your essay and possibly practicing specific grammar and spelling exercises to refine your writing skills. While you've attempted to provide examples to support your points, these examples lack specificity and compelling details. For example, when referencing the situation with pandas or the behavior of visitors at the Dehiwala zoo, providing more detailed evidence or statistics could strengthen your argument. Work on incorporating relevant, specific examples to support your claims more effectively.",

However, other teachers think that offering their students several lessons on the same subject in a row will help them focus more. Which opinion do you think is better?",
          
          "Essay": "Some teachers claim that focus on the same subject help students construction, however the others state that does not work. In my opinion, I think that student spending time on the different subjects can help their score and develop their talent, this essay will discuss both sides.

          Spending time on the different subjects can develop a student's talents. For instance some students may not be good at math but their PE class performance well. As a result, through the different classes  they obtain various opportunities to observe their gifts.
          
          Furthermore, focusing on different classes increases students' horizons. For example, when student learn in high school, they have various classes, such as meth, lecture, geography...etc. These subjects give them different perspectives to know this word. In the end, they are obtained an amount of knowledge. 
          
          On the other hand, some tutors indicate that learning different subjects lead to student's score decrease. The evidence  proves  that students have a lot of assignments need to do, as a result, student could not finish in a limited time. In addition, students feel frustrated by the homework and are not motivated to finish that. 
          
          Overall,  I think that letting students accept various subjects is better than a single subject. Not only can develop their own characteristics, but also increase their foresight.",

          Every individual can follow their dream jobs,irrespective of gender.Nowadays,in modern society,both men and women can learn with similar education and opportunities to develop.Moreover,many places rely on certification and the ability to find employees.No quality and discrimination are a barrier that limits each person’s development.
          
          Nowadays,the development of machines will reduce the advantages of men’s health,and heavy work suitable for men will disappear .And those jobs will be done by machines a robot in the near future.Jobs suitable for men will will decrease and be replaced by job both genders such as programming or tour guide jobs.
          
          Of course,there will be some people who will have the opposite opinion.Foe example,in jobs require physical strength,women will not be able to keep to with men,and in jobs the require care and patience,women will have an advantages because most men ted to be angry.This view may correct,but many studies now show that when both genders work togethere,it creates a more inclusive and diverse environment.Because both ends have different strengthand weakness,they can suppot each other to develop and improve.
          
          In conclusion,it is necessary to think differently about men and women in the workplace because individuals have the right to freedom and education to pursue their career dream.",

          "Question": "Criminality is growing among children and teenagers. Why is it growing and how should these criminals be treated?",
          
          "Essay": "Nowadays, the criminal mindset is growing at an alarming rate, especially among children and teenagers. There are a couple of reasons behind such behavior and there are more than one ways in which a criminal can be treated or punished.

          One of the main reasons behind such activities is a youth's home life. If a person's life is disturbed or violent in any way or form, it may reflect directly onto his actions, which can then lead to horrific activities. Additionally, a young person's brain can be molded easily and lack of attention from their parents leads to unlawful situations. Another major cause is their immediate environment, also known as social life. Many reports have showcased that those who live alone, invest most of the time in violent video games, and do not have a group of friends, have a high tendency of losing their empathy for others, as a result, they start getting involved in criminal activities and begin vandalizing other's properties.
          
          To reduce the ever-increasing rate of crime, how these convicts have been treated plays a crucial role. First and foremost, heavy penalties should be imposed on those who are caught in the investigations, and the charges against them are proved in the court. Since most of the wrongdoers are from backward families, they will think twice before getting involved in any crime as the fine imposed will be impossible for them to bear. Furthermore, based on the criminal investigation and shreds of evidence, a culprit should be treated accordingly. If an offense is critical and violent, then there should be the implementation of a fine as well as the offender should be put in prison. If a person commits a petty crime, then penalties and jail time can be less as compared to someone with more serious charges.
          
          In conclusion, it is quite evident that the wrong behavior starts from one's home and parents need to watch their kids closely and their activities. But, these rising numbers can be reduced if they are treated by the severity of the crime.",

          "Essay": "At present, I am grateful and feel blessed to say that I am currently not facing any significant health issues. My commitment to maintaining optimal health is evident through my active participation in sports, particularly basketball, from elementary school to high school. Throughout the pandemic and continuing until now, I have made a deliberate effort to prioritize physical activity by ensuring I walked over 10,000 steps on weekend mornings. 

          However, I occasionally experience indigestion due to irregular meal times. Hence, since living alone, I have adopted a more consistent eating schedule, complemented by always keeping medications on hand every time I go out. Also, I always try to be mindful of my plate, sorting out  nutritious and balanced meals while reducing sugar intake to maintain a healthy diet in the host country.
          
          Being wary of lifestyle differences, especially in the UK or Singapore, where walking is more prevalent, I have adapted walking to the campus in Depok to minimize transportation costs. This not only contributes to my physical activity but also is more cost-efficient. Additionally, I engage in weekly badminton sessions with friends as a lighter form of exercise. Looking ahead, I plan to continue doing sports in the host country, utilizing the sports facilities and park.
          
          For mental health, I am well aware of its significance, since I faced some challenges during my first year of living alone. I had to accept being surrounded only by myself most of the time, but it was not that severe to do extensive counselling. I learned how to cope by watching my favourite YouTube channel, "Satu Persen". To focus on self-improvement, I dedicated more time to self-reflection and cultivating new habits. 
          
          Interestingly, I have developed a newfound interest in reading, using books to fill the void. Also, incorporating self-journaling, I often express my days through video storytelling in English. Notably, my English language skills have improved significantly, from a previous score of 5.5 last year in a mock test to a more fluent level. This practice not only improved my language skills but also served as a stress release.",

          healthy. It is authorities that should introduce the legislation in order to mitigate environmental
          problems, such as air pollution and more. To illustrate, there should be some laws encouraging
          factories to move to the country sides rather than staying in cities. This could help urban areas to
          be further protected from the poisonous fumes, which are always discharged from firms. Another
          prominent role the government could play would be creating TV programs to educate citizens,
          and to persuade them to care the nature more. Being informed of the consequences of their
          activities, individuals may endeavor to alter their ways, to avoid harming the environment. On the other hand, it is undeniable that each person can play an important role in protecting their
          own neighborhood. Cars are considered to be a major source of air pollution. Their exhaust
          gases contaminate the air, ranging from carbon dioxide to unburnt carbon. Therefore, by using
          their own vehicles only in rare cases, people would be able to protect the environment. Another
          opportunity available to individuals is recycling. By stopping plastic waste from entering and
          contaminating waterways people are able to conserve drinkable water and its inhabitants.
          In conclusion, due to the large amount of work involved, mobilising all the possible forces is a
          more sensible approach. It is, therefore, likely that joint efforts of both the governments and their citizens would result in the most effective way of preserving the environment.

He/she used one body paragraph to discuss whether the government should be responsible for protecting the environment, and the other body paragraph – to discuss whether individuals should be protecting the environment, and how. The ideas are logically sequenced and connected using linking words, making this essay easy to read. Some inaccuracy of expression is evident and requires more work and attention (see corrections underlined in blue). The range of vocabulary is impressive and grammatical errors are quite rare. Overall this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 7.",

          "Question": "Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools. Others, however, believe that boys and girls benefit more from attending mixed schools. 
          Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
          "Essay": "In different countries around the world, there are two types of schools, one where male and female students are mixed and those which are uni-sex. There are two opposite views regarding the benefits of each of these typed of schools. I personally believe that schools registering both genders are more adantagous.

          Considering educating pupils together two main benefits can be mentioned. The first and foremost upside is that students in a mixed gender schhool have an opportunity to educate themselves about the other gender’s characteristics. This is , in turn can help them to build successful relationships in the future. Another positive point with this educational system is that it stimulate an environment for students which is very similar to what they will encounter at their work place in their adulthood. This can definitely help both girls and boys to have more successful job experience. These two points are very strong supports showing how mixed education can positively affect student’s life in the future.
          
          On the other hand, there are people who support the idea of separating boys and girls at schools. One of the positive aspects at this approach is that such schools can better educated their students by focusing on  their unique needs and talents in terms of their gender. In addition, when boys and girls, are separated, their level of distraction will obviously decrease during their learning sessions. This point has been actually concluded by a survey conducted in 2010 by ministry of education among teenagers with an age range of 13 to 17. Given the above reasons, one may argue that separated schools are more affective to reach theirs educational role.
          
          In conclusion, both of these educational systems have their own benefits. However, I believe that education in a mix environment is by far more beneficial than education in a schools where  pupils of different sex are seperated.

However, there are some areas that could be improved for a higher band score. The essay contains a few spelling errors, and one mistake is repeated, which impacts the lexical resource score. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by providing clearer connections to the favorable school of thought.
